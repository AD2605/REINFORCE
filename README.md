# REINFORCE Algorithm
This is an implementation of Monte Carlo Policy Gradients, also known as REINFORCE algorithm, tested on a Bipedal System. 

## Dependency 
Open AI GYM. 

## TO DO
Deploy agents on an Evolutionary Basis. 

## Results (Uptil Now)

The smart ass decided to stay in this position even after 100 episodes. Policy Gradient model probably required a deeper model as performance improves with a deeper model
